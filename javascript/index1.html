       <h1>Arrays and Strings Methods</h1>
       <!-- String: string is nothing but sequence or combination of characters which are enclosed with in single codes or double codes\
            or back-ticks
            and it is a primitive-data-type in js JavaScript directly stores them in memory.
            it is immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be altered (though new strings can be formed based on manipulations).
            
            we can create string in a two ways
            1) by using string-literals
               let str="hello"
               clg(str)//hello
               clg(typeOf str)//string
            2) by using new keyword
            let str=new String('hello')
            clg(str)//str
            clg(typeOf str)//object

            back-tick example for multiple lines 
            embed expressions (like variables or operations) directly into strings
            let a=10
            let b=20
            let c=30
        interpolation
        clg(`the sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${c})
        -->
